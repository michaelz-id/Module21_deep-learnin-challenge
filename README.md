<h2>Module21 Challenge Report</h2>

<h3>Purpose of Analysis</h3>
Purpose of this analysis is to create a model to help predict an applicants rate of success based on the features in the dataset.
Using TensorFlow,  preprocess, compile, train, and evaluate the binary classification model to calculate the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy.

Test the model and optimise it to improve the model output
